# --- input-shape guard (#816) -----------------------------------------------
# The file-list argument is a list of PATHS, one per line -- not a diff. Handed
# a diff, the scan loop reads each diff line as a path, matches nothing, emits
# nothing, and exits 0: an output indistinguishable from a genuinely clean scan.
# That is the #538/#571 failure (a gate that sits inert and reads as a pass)
# reached through the INPUT rather than the runtime, and it is easy to hit --
# both inputs come from adjacent `git diff` invocations differing only by
# `--name-only`, and both are plausibly named `*.diff`.
#
# Two checks, deliberately different in severity:
#
#   DIFF SHAPE -> hard failure (exit 1). Unambiguous: no file list contains a
#     `diff --git`/`@@`/`+++`/`--- ` line, so there is no legitimate input this
#     rejects, and the silent-zero scan is exactly what the caller must not get.
#
#   NOTHING RESOLVES -> stderr warning, exit code UNCHANGED. This one cannot be
#     an error: a list naming only deleted files is legitimate (the paths are
#     gone by design), and an EMPTY list exiting 0 in silence is a contract
#     tests/validate-prescans.sh pins for every pre-scan. So it is a warning
#     that catches stale lists and wrong-cwd invocations without breaking either
#     real case -- which is why it is guarded on a NON-EMPTY list.
#
# BASH_SOURCE[0], not $0: inside a function it names the file this function was
# DEFINED in, so the message stays correct under a symlink, a relative
# invocation from another cwd, or a `source` -- the same reasoning the SCRIPT_DIR
# computation elsewhere in these scanners uses.
# The multi-byte Unicode format characters the reflected line must not carry:
# the zero-width family (U+200B-200F), bidi overrides/embeddings (U+202A-202E),
# bidi isolates (U+2066-2069) and BOM (U+FEFF). A bidi override is the dangerous
# one: it makes the reflected text RENDER reversed, so a hostile path can display
# as something other than what it is.
#
# Built with printf as LITERAL UTF-8 bytes, not written as \xNN escapes -- those
# are a GNU sed extension that BSD sed reads as literal text, which is the silent
# #679 failure class (the pattern stops matching and nothing reports it).
# An ALTERNATION, not a bracket class: a bracket over multi-byte sequences
# matches byte-wise and can split a character.
#
# This is what keeps the bash fallback in step with _strip_control() in the
# python primary, whose isprintable() rejects category Cf for free. Without it
# the two runtimes diverge on exactly the path the fallback exists to serve
# (measured: RTLO survived in bash, was stripped in python).
